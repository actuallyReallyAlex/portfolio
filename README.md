# Alex Lee | Portfolio

I wanted to step away from the overdone Bootstrap template portfolio sites, and try out writing my own portfolio using React.

I also came across [Grommet](https://grommet.io/) and decided this would be a good project to try it out with.

## Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Grommet](https://grommet.io/)
- [Docz](https://www.docz.site/)
- [react-tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tilt)
